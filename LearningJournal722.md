# Learning Journal
## July 22 2017

Ok I am getting to that time in class where I'm just super tired and starting to get sick. I slept in until 11:20 today and I needed it. I think I am coming down with something - and there's been a couple people in class who have been kind of fighting off a cold/etc so I'm going to try to rest up this weekend. Mostly, I have been having really bad headaches off and on for the last three days. 
Other than that, I'm still a little confused on the stuff we learned this week. I feel the SQL stuff is understandable and I have a basic idea of what's going on with the whole HTTP requests, cycle of response/request, but I also feel like I'm just missing something somewhere. I took the quiz this week and apparently I know things, it's just that I feel a little like **do I really know them? Do I?** 
Next week we tackle pushing things into deployment and some stuff about APIs which I am looking forward to. I am getting excited for project week because I'd like to be able to sort of tie together what I have been learning over the last two weeks. I feel like everyday has been 'HEY HERE IS HANDLEBARS! GO!' and then the next day is like 'Oh you thought you needed to understand Handlebars? Pffft let's throw that out and learn something new - GO!' I get that CF wants to kind of "stack" learning on top of each other to do like a stepping-stone to the next thing but I'd rather just learn one thing instead of all these intermediate steps that feel kinda stupid. Also, I get really confused because one day we did it this way but now we do it another way and sometimes the path of the stepping stones is not totally clear to me because I'm just like "PUSH KNOWLEDGE INTO BRAIN Y/N Y" 
I am debating whether or not to take a month off in between 301 and 401. Depends on how tired I am after week 3, I think. I am the kind of person who needs about 9 hours of sleep a day (unfortunately) and this kind of schedule really only allows for about 6. On the other hand, I don't really want to put myself at a disadvantage by doing that, since I now know people in class and like this group. 

Month off advantages: 
- Would have time to study that coding book (prepping for the code interview or whatever)
- Could "pre-learn" some of the stuff for 401 to feel a little more comfortable *this definitely helped going into 301
- Would have time to read Eloquent JS/etc 
- Would have time to go to more meetups (although I'd have to really force myself to go to them since historically that didn't go great last time) 

Neutral but just some stuff I'm thinking about:
- Would have time to get all my ducks in a row in terms of resume/web presence, although that will also be happening in 401

Cons: 
- I then graduate at the end of Oct (terrible timing) 
- I also have to live at home without being in school for a longer period of time (not ideal) 
- I might get bored like last month
- Sometimes I don't use time effectively if there is no structure
- Since sister is moving back, I won't really have a good place to study, may have to help her with stuff

I think I'm not going to take the month off, but I also feel pressured to go to meetups and try to make connections and all that jazz - I just don't know how more work in 401 on top of turning up the heat on the job search is going to really go. 

Also I am trying to make some decisions about where to focus my job search. After talking to Scott, it sounds like finding a job overseas after this is surprisingly not impossible. I was planning to take a year in Seattle to get some dev xp under my belt and then try to make a move to something else (either Tech Project Management in Seattle or doing more dev work in Berlin) but it sounds like maybe I can actually focus on getting to Berlin. The idea of that is like unbelievably exciting, but I have to get going on building some networking to get myself there. One thing that would be good to do is to know which companies here have ties to Germany and would be willing to hire there (MSFT, Amazon, Tableau? etc). The thing is that Berlin is not a very big hub for tech overseas arms, unless you are doing design or a startup. 

Another option is to go to Ireland for a year, which I am actually not opposed to either. It would kind of be a stepping stone to the mainland and I already speak the language, which is a plus. Dublin has a thriving tech scene and I know for sure that there are overseas arms of some of the bigger companies there. I should talk to Natascha and see what she has to say. Also maybe Kat? I wish I knew more people actually working in Tech in Berlin - that would be definitely helpful. 

A third option is France, which seems like a long shot to me. Although, granted, I don't know much about their new tech visa program but in the last week two people have suggested it to me. And, I speak french so that is a plus opposed to Germany where I can just muddle through. I would love France tbh because Paris is spectacular any time of year and the whole city **is** art. 

Fourth and fifth options are in Canada. Canada is kind of a boring alternative to Europe but would offer steady health care. Montreal is one option, given Ubisoft and couple others are there, although because they expect bilingualness level 9000 b/c everyone speaks dual, it could be challenging. (I feel like if France is opening it up then the lingua franca must be English, although it would be good to check that). Vancouver is last on the list because I am kinda meh about the city in general and the housing costs are astronomical. I had a look the other day at the cost of housing vs. the average dev salary and it was surprising. On the plus side, it's closer to home, so there is that. Also, I would have an easier time getting a position there given that there is that Go North meetup. I'm still interested in that place doing the legal timer thing for lawyers. I should check back in with them to remind them I met them in May and just to see if they even need Jr Devs later on. 

Anyhooooo I gotta do laundry because my whole room is just like
