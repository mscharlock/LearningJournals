#Learning Journal

Today we started working on our app in earnest. Apparently we can't use the API. But I'm learning a lot from pair programming with David. He's great with JS but I actually caught some things, so I feel like I'm being sorta useful. I took the exam this afternoon but I think I should have waited because my brain was kinda fried by the end of the day. I did pass but I feel like I could have done better.
