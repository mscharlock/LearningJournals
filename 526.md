# Learning Journal

Today we started working on our app in earnest. Apparently we can't use the API. But I'm learning a lot from pair programming with David. He's great with JS but I actually caught some things, so I feel like I'm being sorta useful. 

I took the exam this afternoon but I think I should have waited because my brain was kinda fried by the end of the day. I did pass but I feel like I could have done better.
### Fun Fact: This was written from a bar on friday night ðŸ¤· You do what you gotta do

Anyway...I am actually excited for project week. Despite Wednesday being my day of "Waaaah! Everything is terrible!" sleep did help and by the end of the week I was feeling a little more capable. I even sorted the chart out in Bus Mall today with minimal assistance. I think my problem is that I just need to practice. I feel like I can kinda wade through a couple assignments but if you asked me to put some stuff in a table I would be a little ðŸ˜¬

Today (Saturday) I am working on getting stuff up to snuff. I'd like to be done with all my assignments by Sunday but we'll see. My sister is in town from AZ so that makes timing challenging. So far, I've retaken all my quizzes and gotten the last of the JS errors fixed in Salmon Cookies (I know, right, I'm so behind...ðŸ˜¢)

Now onto BusMall. ONE DAY I WILL FINISH YOU BUS MALL, ONE DAY!!!
