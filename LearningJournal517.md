Just when you think everything is working a giant random roadblock comes out of nowhere and seems to just attack. I'm the pigeon feeder guy fending off the irritating roadblock. But on the other hand, some stuff is becoming slightly more clear:

-I figured out how the table stuff actually works, instead of just c/p and not really getting it, so at least I feel like I have a better grip on the DOM stuff
-I figured out how to get the results from the exterior prototype functions to show up as properties within my store objects
-I have a loose grasp on how the whole submitting thing works - there's something wrong in the code for sure, but at least I understand the concept of what I'm supposed to be doing. I just can't look at it any more today! GO AWAY PIGEON GEEZ

What I can't figure out is how to get my array of the salesCalc to print out in the table. I think it has to do with it being an array that I'm trying to jam into a td instead of logging each individual value into it's own td?

Tomorrow is another day!!
