The presentation went surprisingly well! I randomly flubbed some stuff but it was fine. Someone even was really excited to put in the Konami code, which was exciting. I have to say, I was impressed with all of our projects - they're pretty awesome. I really liked aspects of every single one! The D&D was probably my favorite although I can definitely see myself using the drink one or the workout one too. I admired the states guessing game for their insane layout of divs on that map - it looked really hard to create! 

Over the weekend I have been sleeping to catch up on all the shut eye I've missed over the last month. I took yesterday off from working on code and it felt practically sinful. I actually am hankering to get started on the jQuery stuff, so I'm excited to get back into it. I may even buy a whiteboard to practice this stuff! Also, I got a study guide from Brian, which will be helpful on the month off. 

Looking forward to 301!
