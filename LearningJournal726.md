Current State of My Server:

Honestly I am feeling a bit lost right about now. I actually came in this morning feeling ok about things, but then kind of floundered on the portfolio assignment where you have to turn everything into SPA routing. Since I was already a little confused by map and reduce not working, that just compounded my problems on the portfolio. I think maybe I have been doing my portfolio wrong all this time because I haven't been checking it on localhost:3000?

I screwed with it for at least 2 hours tonight and I have no idea why it doesn't accept the file paths for my css and js files. I tried putting in a GET request because initially it was giving me the whole 'Cannot Get' thing. So maybe I don't understand servers as well as I thought I did! The last couple labs have made sense to me (sort of) but honestly, I feel like I could use a weekend to just go through all of our lab code again and watch the lectures a second time. 

Anyhooooo I will be in late tomorrow so it seems like Thursday evening is going to be me and a TA figuring out why nothing is working... I am trying not to have a bad attitude about all this but I am just kind of cranky from coding all day every day for 17 days straight
