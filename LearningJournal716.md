Well, we all collectively decided to meet up on Sunday to do the lab work, since the whole lab due dates/no starter code/etc was just kind of weird.

Mostly, I am just super tired today, which means I'm also grumpy. So...mehhhh. I have to do a lot of CSS portfolio work today, since I did the Code Wars stuff and got the js for my portfolio working yesterday. The good thing is that I now understand Handlebars and finally got it to work, but the bad news is that the CSS for this site is jacked up thanks to everything having it's own classes and ids and a bunch of them aren't even assigned to anything. I'd rather start from scratch at this point! UGH. 

Anyways...off to code.
