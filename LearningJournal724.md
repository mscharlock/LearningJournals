I'm tired today but that is not really anything new. I'm excited about getting into the lab tomorrow AM because this page.js thing looks like it will resolve a lot of the confusingness of how to assign everything to different routes. 
To be honest, I feel like I am a little behind or not keeping up with some of the stuff we learned last week. I tried to do the portfolio map and reduce stuff today and I'm still confused. I don't know why I find them so confusing! Conceptually, I get what they're doing - and I think my problem in the portfolio is that I'm not appending them properly. I need to have a look at it with a TA because I'm not entirely sure why stuff is not showing up on the page. 

Also I edited Kimmer's portfolio today for about 1 1/2 hours which was a good review of some of the stuff we learned last week. I feel like I have a good understanding of how stuff like Handlebars and SQL is working, but I'm fuzzy as soon as it comes to stuff replacing other stuff (so, anything where there's a lot of methods working with properties of objects, like article.all.aMethod = thing.author.article...all that craziness). I don't know why that is so confusing but I think it just needs a little more time to sink in? It always seems like I get it in lab but then I go to actually do something with it and I can kind of explain my way through a file to the point where I feel like I know what stuff is sort of referring to, but not to the point where I feel really comfortable with it yet. I'm hoping that by using page.js that helps with some of the confusion, but maybe it won't? 

Other than that, labs have been going pretty well. Honestly most of the difficulty is just trying to read the files to figure out what object inside of an object with a property or whatever is going on. I don't know if this is a problem unique to how JS is structured, but I just feel like the fact that everything is an object in JS is totally annoying. I kind of want to learn a language that is not OOP because it seems like such an odd way to think about things. Conceptually, the idea of methods having to live "on" objects is just totally weird to me still. Like, why not write a language where the methods can just be used whenever, wherever? Why do they have to be associated with a thing at all? Granted, my knowledge of OOP is limited and I know basically nothing about other languages, so maybe it already exists out there somewhere or maybe it's not possible for some reason yet unknown to me. 

Anyhoo going to bed!
