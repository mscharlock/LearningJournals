Lab today was a little bit:

I don't know how jQuery got so confusing all of a sudden, but I'm definitely confused about what's selecting what in assignments. Conceptually, I get the idea of selecting something and then doing something, but I think I really need to walk through the selectors that we went over today a couple more times. Am I correct in assuming there's no demo code from today? I didn't see it up on the lab repo. I suppose I could go through the videos to look for it but I haven't had time at the moment. I looked through my notes, but I'm still just confused about when to use concatenation and how to select stuff that has it's own data-attribute thing.

Labs went well today! This morning Brendan and I managed to solve everything in about 2 hours, which actually flew by. It was fun to see jQuery in action and doing stuff! I get stupidly excited when it does what it's supposed to do. In the afternoon, Austin and I spent about an hour trying to figure out how to get one thing to hide/show in the lab, but it was very exciting when we got it to work. Using jQuery is the first time I'm actually feeling that "OMG IT WORKS OMG OMG" feeling that many of my classmates seemed to have all throughout 201.

Also, I'm finding that while the labs are hard, they're not impossible (which is how the 201 labs felt). Not sure why this is, but it's exciting. Also, I actually learn a ton more when I am pair programming, because you can mutually teach each other stuff (unless, we both don't get it, haha). 

Portfolio is rolling along - yesterday I felt like "OMG WHAT I HAVE BITTEN OFF MORE THAN I CAN CHEW AUGH" but today it's more like "Oh hey, this .hide/show stuff was what I was planning all along!" *evil cackle* So I feel a bit better about it. I'm still behind on the styling and the actual look of the thing (because right now it is uuuuuuuugly) but I'm hoping to do more tomorrow AM on it, pending that the rest of the lab from today doesn't take too long. 

If my portfolio could talk:

What is so nice about this group of people in class is that everyone is really willing to help each other out, compare solutions, review your code, tell you what they know, explain concepts you don't understand, etc. It's really great! Definitely different than the previous group.
