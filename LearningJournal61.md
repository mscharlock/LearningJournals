^ We're all slightly frazzled on team Tweet Fighter but hey we made a thing!

How is it already June?! Time feels a little weird. It seems like it was just a few days ago that we started this thing and now it's ending. But it also feels like it's been a long slog because I've been working hard and cramming so much into my brain - so it's kind of bizarre! 

Today we worked on the last little touch ups to Tweet Fighter. It culminated with us trying to figure out how this button got out of place and screwing with CSS for an hour and a half. I'm just glad that it's mostly functional but also sad that we can't showcase all the features (like getting tweets to appear). 

Tomorrow is presentation day. I wish I could say I was excited but I am just nervous right now. The idea that this will be on Youtube for all time and posterity makes it feel like there is a lot of pressure riding on it. I just hope I don't end up tripping all over or saying something about APIs that makes no sense since we still don't totally get what they are. Meh! 

I think I'm going to try to make my own little web app over the month while we're off. I still like the idea behind the whole "here's nonprofits you can donate to when you're totally annoyed about Trump strip mining in national parks" or whatever. But it would also be cool to do some kind of game thing, since it doesn't seem that hard to do things based on keystrokes.
