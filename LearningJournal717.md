We covered AJAX in today's class and the lab actually went pretty well - Ian and I finished it around 7pm, which was really exciting, considering we didn't actually start until around 5! I feel like this is the first time that I've really been able to use the lecture demo, plus some info from docs on MDN, plus our collective knowledge to really solve one of these labs.

The lab yesterday was hard - and I feel like I sort of get it after having done a review of the lab in class, but I need to practice it a bit more before I feel like it will be very solid. While I probably wouldn't have been able to solve it given my current skills, it didn't make me depressed or discouraged to not have solved it because I was most of the way there. I think having some clearer demo code might have helped, but maybe not. It seems like it's just a hard lab - and actually, that's sort of good, because there's probably going to be days in the real workplace where you can't solve something. It's good to know how to deal with the frustration of failure, in a way - and be able to pick yourself up. If that's the one thing I learned in 201 it's that tomorrow is another day and every day I'm learning something new at my own pace. I really appreciate that I learned that then rather than now! 
Also, I was quite surprised to hear today in class that people had so much to say about the time that class meets (to me, the schedule seems fine and I actually don't want it to change). That, and it seemed like people were really upset about availability of TAs to help out - but I just want to reiterate that the TAs have been doing a great job. I haven't had a problem finding people or getting help when I need it. Granted, I'm being proactive - I don't think TAs need to circulate. Part of learning how to work in this field is knowing how to reach out for help instead of just waiting for it to come to you. And frankly, this class is going at a much easier and gentle pace than the last class I was in, so I guess maybe I am seeing things from a bit of a different perspective? I don't know.
