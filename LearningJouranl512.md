I know this is long, so I **bolded** the important points

Well, it's been a week! I actually feel like **I'm understanding about 75-80% of what's going on.** I feel like I get the conceptual idea of most things, but it's really just the loops that are still throwing me for a loop. Because the homework has been taking me a while to complete, **I haven't had time to re-look through things and do many corrections.** After doing the pair-programming assignment, I got to look at some code for some of the loops that _did_ work which was helpful - so I _should_ be able to do them. **Loops just still seem tricky to me for some reason.** I think I might have to do some practice problems with loops (while and for!) in my spare time.

**The HTML/CSS actually seems to make a lot of sense, as do basic functions** (although the wrapping around was a little challenging given that we were trying to wrap in the wrong way). I think I totally get the wrap-around now, and today's function assignment seemed briefly easy but...then again, who knows what the future holds...!

**But the week emotionally has been pretty up and down** - I felt pretty stupid to be the like the last person working in a pair on Thursday night. But, I actually learned a lot from the pair-programming thing so...then I felt pretty good because I'd actually cemented some of the things I was learning. ~~But I just felt like maybe everybody else who'd already gone home already got everything and I'm just a dunderhead.~~

**I have honestly no idea how well I am doing in relation to the rest of the class.** I guess there's not a good way to tell who is doing well vs. not well since we all have different amounts of experience. Anyway, I just ride this wave of feeling totally confused, totally stupid and then I briefly get something and then a couple things I really get and then there's like one or two things I still have no idea what's going on with them and then we move on to a whole new set of stuff. I guess I feel a little stressed from the workload (because I feel the time-pressure - I feel like with enough time I can get most things).

### What we've learned this week that I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on:
---
* [ x ] Terminal commands - I feel like I've really gotten better at this! It's becoming second nature.
* [ x ] I feel like Git is coming along but isn't quite natural yet. ACP is going good but branches/merge conflicts/copying individual files from one repo to another (is that even possible?) still is a little _hrmmmmm_
* [ x ] HTML stuff - seems ok
* [ x ] CSS - seems pretty straightforward

Things I still need help with/need to review over the weekend:
* [  ] EFFING LOOPS
* [  ] Also I don't think we ever went over a do while, so I have to look that up
