How is it already week 3?! I feel like time is flying.
I'm still a little confused on: inserting things into the HTML via the DOM. I don't know why this is tripping me up, but it appears to be the thing I'm not understanding that well in our assignment today.

I feel like I understand a lot more of today's assignment, which is exciting.
Basically, it's a giant for loop on the outside, saying iterate from 1 - 25

_Inside that, we're going:_
* Ok, make a bunch of objects representing each of the images
* Put those images in an array
* Have a separate array to put the images we just used
* When we click, have it log a click to the object clicked
* When we click, have it push the image we clicked into the used image array
* Use a for loop to go through all the images and pick a random one
* If we haven't used the thing before (aka, it isn't in our used array) then use it
* Otherwise, pick again

I wrote it all out today basically doing it for individual pictures and then tried refactoring into a larger fcn. I think that is the right thing to do but still working on it.
