# Learning Journal
## July 10 2017
I'm BACK! It feels good to be back in class again! I feel kind of rusty on things, but I'm sure I'll catch up here soon. I did end up coding more days than not during my month-long break/study time but the end two weeks there got kind of busy with other life things. So, I didn't do the 4 hours of practicing religiously like I wanted to, but at least it was something and I got to catch up on my sleep!

This time I am in a class that actually has other ladies in it! Exciting! In general, this class seems definitely less "dog-eat-dog" than the last one I was in. Everyone is really friendly and seems very willing to work together, which is nice!

**Today we learned about:**
- RWD
- MVC
- Icons that come from fonts
- Setting up a meta tag that allows you to change the viewport/etc.
Pair programming went well and we actually stuck to the 15 minutes rule which was a refreshing change. We got stuck on how to find the icon - I ended up thinking it was a more complicated process than it actually was and ended up downloading some stuff to look for this html file that was supposed to have the references of the codes for each image. Turns out, you just have to search on icomoon to find the name and then refer to the codebase which had a preexisting class set up for the hamburger menu. Who knew!

I feel like I should know more about media queries from today than I ended up coming away from class knowing. Hopefully we will either go over them again or maybe we didn't do as deep a dive into them today as we will tomorrow? I will have to ask.

Anyway, I feel _cautiously_ optimistic about this class.

I feel like I at least have some idea of what we will be learning (as opposed to 201, where it was just "HERE HAVE LOTS OF KNOWLEDGE" with no real map).

I've started working on Code Wars. I don't know if it's that I am just rusty or I'm bad at logic or what but they seem really hard to me. I keep skipping different challenges because I can't think of how to solve them. I really dislike how their system performs tests to check if you got the solution. I end up working on them in repl because I usually just want to work incrementally and console.log as I go. It's kind of impossible to do that with the Code Wars system, so I guess I will just keep copying over to Repl.

I am working on doing the extra credit from the prework, although they are taking me quite a while. I hope we are going to go over .every .map .filter .reduce etc because I feel like that's what I should be using in these. Also, there is a bug in the first one (it says the answer should give 3 Bs when only 2 exist) and weirdly if you have answers in the console.log it doesn't "count". So, I'll have to ask about that.

I am dog sitting and this dog keeps getting me up at 5:30am. I am not a morning person, so I better go to bed.
