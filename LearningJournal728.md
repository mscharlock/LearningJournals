  I am very excited about our group project!
  
  Today in lab we went over the entire day 14 file and tried to figure out what each thing was doing. This was actually really helpful because yesterday while I was trying to do portfolio stuff I ended up looking at that file a lot but not really understanding all of the relations. It was also good to work with Anthony because I am very 40,000 foot view: "ok this is doing...something with some stuff...let's move on" and he's a details guy: "no no let's look at what this one variable is actually doing." We balanced each other out. 
  
  Lab 14 says we have to use middleware which is a bit weird because I thought we were already doing that by installing body parser - I think they want us to put in some "middleware" function-y type stuff in there somewhere. I kinda wish we had had another day on the middleware stuff, because I don't really understand it that well.

  In other news, I am about 1/2 way to kyu 6 in Code Wars. I keep trying katas and just not figuring them out - on a lot of them, I feel like I'm really close but not quite there. Also, do we get partial points on this? The amount of time it is taking me to do these katas is ridiculous. I mean, I think they're helpful, but I also have a lot of other things I'd like to do, like review all my notes so I feel prepped for the test on Sunday, get all my resubmits in, finish up portfolio 14...etc

Ninja powers activate!
