I spent a bunch of time yesterday cramming stuff into my brain. I don't know if I succeeded or not, but today I feel like the way that everything is interacting between M-V-C is starting to make more sense. Also fun fact, last night I discovered that my stupid portfolio page has never had properly hooked up JSON. Also, it still isn't pulling info from JSON. I submitted it anyway in my final exam because...

In other news, I am still working on the portfolio today to do the context thing (which tbh I still don't really understand now that I am working with it). I've managed to fix some lingering weird errors (getting the Nav to properly open/close without stop.propagation()). 

Also I would like to put it out there that I feel like I spent the majority of yesterday trying to google/teach myself stuff in the final exam that wasn't covered in class. Is that the point of the test, seeing as it is open book/internet/whatever? Maybe I just missed stuff in class and we did cover everything? I don't know. I passed, but still...not impressed.
