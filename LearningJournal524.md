# Learning Journal

I think I'm just overtired today. I had a really hard time staying focused in this morning's lecture and I'm still behind on BusMall. In fact, I didn't even take a look at local storage yet because I'm just trying to get this stupid thing to work. Every day I feel like I have a better understanding of the problem domain, but I also feel like I put a lot of things into one function on Tuesday so today in lab I spent most of my time undoing that. Once I get it to spit out the string of object.clicked values the storage and the chart pieces should be fine. I got a basic chart working yesterday but because I don't have that string yet, I can't get it to hook into anything.  

Since I was busy this evening at that mentoring event, I feel even more behind. But tomorrow I am hoping to get back in the swing of things - I just really need to sleep. I'm truly exhausted and I think that's actually largely what is holding me back from getting some stuff this week. I'm sure this is normal but I just feel very discouraged today. I feel like I just can't learn fast enough? I keep asking for help but then I also feel bad because I sort of want to struggle a bit on my own to figure stuff out, but I also get stuck just about every 1/2 hr.

Anyway, I will update this entry tomorrow, since I do want to submit one that has some information in it instead of just "waah waah waah I'm tired"
